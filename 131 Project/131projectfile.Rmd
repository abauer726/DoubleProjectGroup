## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abauer726/DoubleProjectGroup/main/131%20Project/Spotify%20Dataset/music.csv?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQVVO3OPO66XXKMIJFCVAKWYPJ74BQ")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

#hmmmmm hey hey hey
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
