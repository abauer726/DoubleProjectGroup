# New research question: can we predict if a song will be a hit based on its attributes? Response variable: song.hotttnesss 

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=T}
energy <- ggplot(music,aes(x=energy,y=popularity))+geom_point()
energy

liveness <- ggplot(music,aes(x=liveness, y=popularity))+geom_point()
liveness
```


```{r}
valence <- ggplot(music, aes(x=valence, y=popularity))+geom_point(alpha=0.2) + facet_grid(vars(danceability))
valence
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
