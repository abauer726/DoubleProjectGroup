## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
music <- read.csv("/Users/Grant/DoubleProjectGroup/131 Project/Spotify Dataset/musicdata.csv")
View(music)


# New research question: can we predict if a song will be a hit based on its attributes? Response variable: song.hotttnesss 

```

```{r}
# randomly subset syntax, with 100 points (couldnt run this due to the file not loading)

sample <- music[sample(nrow(music), 100), ]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=T}
energy <- ggplot(sample,aes(x=energy,y=popularity))+geom_point()
energy

liveness <- ggplot(sample,aes(x=liveness, y=popularity))+geom_point()
liveness
```


```{r}
valence <- ggplot(sample, aes(x=valence, y=popularity))+geom_point(alpha=0.2) + facet_grid(vars(danceability))
valence
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
